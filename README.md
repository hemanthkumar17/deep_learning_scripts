# Deep Learning Scripts

- Contains a detailed code for multilayer perceptron network build from base python modules powered by basic gradient descent
- Contains a basic CNN implementation on Tensorflow.Keras with weights visualization, as well as layer visualization via deconvolution.
- Contains a basic RNN implementation on Tensorflow.Keras (BUG Alert: Runs slower than TF1 implementation)
    - A TF1 version is attached at the end which (miraculously) runs faster than TF2.Keras
